<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Why I Created This Website</h2>
<p>
  This blog was created as a compilation of notes that I'm making while coding.
  Sometimes, I realized that I was repeating the same process of scouring the
  internet for pieces of a puzzle and making the same mistakes. Here, I hope to
  help myself in the future when I forget something while also assisting others
  too.
</p>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>
  I am a Fullstack web developer with experience in Javascript/Typescript,
  Python, and C#. My first job as a programmer was back in 2019 at an already
  well-consolidated educational platform startup. During the COVID isolation, I
  started working remotely for a large company in Prague, Czech Republic.
</p>
<p>
  Nowadays, I'm working on a game that I plan to release on both PC and
  Smartphones. The game runs on the Unity Engine and is written in C#.
</p>
<p>
  I also have a bachelor's degree in Architecture and Urban Planning and a
  Post-graduation as a Software Architect. I guess you can tell by this that I
  love working on projects overall.
</p>
<p>
  During my bachelor's, I studied for 1 year in Groningen, Netherlands, at the
  University of Groningen, which helped me improve my English and gave me the
  opportunity to visit a few places in Europe.
</p>
<p>
  Now I'm living back home in Brazil in a small apartment with my beloved cat
  called Lily.
