<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Why I created this website</h1>
This blog was created as a compilation of notes that I'm making while coding. Sometimes I realized that I was repeating the same process of scouring the internet for pieces of a
puzzle and doing the same mistakes. Here i hope to help myself in the future
when I forget something while also helping others too.

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>
    Fullstack web developer with experience in Javascript/Typescript, Python and C#. My first job as a programmer was back at 2019 at an already well consolidated educational platform startup. During covid isolation I started working remotely for a large company in Prague, Czech Republic.
</p>
<p>
    Nowadays I'm working in a game that I plan to release on both PC and Smartphones. The game runs with Unity Engine and is written in C#.
</p>
<p>I also have a bachelor in Architecture and Urban Planning and a Pos-graduation as a Software Architec. I guess you can tell by this that I love working with projects overall.
    
<p>
    During my bachelor I studied for 1 year in Groningen, Netherlands at the University of Groningen, which helped me to improve my English and gave me the opportunity to visit a few places in Europe.</p>
</p>    
<p>
    Now I'm living back home in Brazil in a small apartment with my loved cat called Lily.
