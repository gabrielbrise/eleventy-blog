      <main><h1>How to host your static website on AWS S3</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Every now and then I decide to make a website simple enough to be static. Using the buckets from AWS S3 you can &quot;quickly&quot; set-up your website, however, to properly set-up it with a certificate and your own domain, there are a few extra steps that I always forget how to do. Thus, I'm making this article to help me in the future and hopefully help others too.</p>
<h2>Create a new S3 bucket</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go to Amazon S3 &gt; Buckets &gt; Create bucket</li>
<li>Choose your prefered AWS Region (probably not that important since we are going to have CDN with CloudFront)</li>
<li>Untick &quot;Block all public access&quot; at &quot;Block Public Access settings for this bucket&quot;
<ul>
<li>After unticking it, tick &quot;I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create bucket</li>
</ul>
<h2>Activate the S3 static website hosting</h2>
<ul>
<li>With your newly created bucket, go to Properties and scroll down to the end of the page</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to activate the static website hosting</li>
<li>Now you should have an ugly link that goes to your http static website, yeey!</li>
<li>The nexts steps will be for those who want https and your custom domain, but if what we achieved so far is enough you can stop here</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting an AWS Certificate for your website</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go to AWS Certificate Manager &gt; Certificates</li>
<li>For some reason, I always make the mistake to create the certificate in the closest region to me, but only N.Virginia (us-east-1) works with CloudFront. So, check the top right corner of the screen and make sure you're at us-east-1 before creating your certificate</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to get your certificate and fill your domain when asked for it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Route 53 to use your custom domain</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go to AWS Route 53 &gt; Hosted zones &gt; Create hosted zone</li>
<li>Follow the instructions and create hosted zone</li>
<li>Inside there should be a Record of type NS with a bunch of AWS DNS links</li>
<li>Go to your domain provider and fill those in the custom DNS configuration, this will allow AWS to route stuff for you while using your custom domain</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a CloudFront distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go to AWS CloudFront &gt; Distributions &gt; Create distribution</li>
<li>At Origin &gt; Origin domain, choose your S3 bucket</li>
<li>Check the options for anything that may interested you and then click &quot;Create distribution&quot;</li>
<li>Now you should have another link that leads to your website</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configure your custom domain back at Route 53</h2>
<ul>
<li>Back at your hosted zone at Route 53, click &quot;Create record&quot;</li>
<li>Select Record Type A</li>
<li>Tick &quot;Alias&quot;, this will enable you to Route traffic to your CloudFront distribution</li>
<li>Choose your distribution</li>
<li>Create record</li>
<li>Go make yourself a sandwich and hopefully in a few minutes you'll be able to reach your website throuh your custom domain with HTTPS</li>
</ul>
